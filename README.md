# üêπ todo

A simple command-line todo manager written in Go for those who have at least one open terminal at any point in time.

This project started as a way to learn Go ‚Äî its syntax, tooling, and ecosystem. I now actually use it daily, since it's lightweight, lives in the terminal, and is always just a few keystrokes away. Not as a todo manager for long-lived tasks, but rather to streamline my thoughts when working on, for example, a ticket. Usually, my commits reflect the todos I had set up beforehand.

## ‚ú® Features

- Add, list, complete, move, and delete todos
- Multiple task lists ("packages") via `todo packages`
- Configurable storage path
- Minimal dependencies, fast and local

## üöÄ Getting Started

You could point your storage path to one that gets synched by e.g. Google Drive
to be able to access your todos on any machine.

```bash
todo init       # Setup config and storage path
todo add "Learn Go"
todo list
```

## üîç Why Go?

This project helped me explore:

- the Go module system and standard library
- structuring CLI apps with urfave/cli/v2
- unit testing and temporary file handling
- writing tools I actually use
